## Contribution Guidelines:
- Make a separate folder for the Script.
- There shouldn't be any spaces in the scripts' names. Usage of underscores ('_') or dashes ('-') in place of spaces is allowed. Ex. "Script_One.py" or "Script-One.py" is preferred as compared to "Script One.py"
- The folder should contain Python Script, and its respective supporting files (if any) and a separate `README.md` File with proper documentation.
