# Object Detection

The following python script 'object_detection.py' uses a library called OpenCV, which is used in the field of computer vision. The following script runs an object detection algorithm using a haar cascade classifier algorithm. When playing around, please change the path of the haar cascade to your desirable output. 

The output of the script will draw bounding boxes around objects and classify them. The script uses the live webcam as its input.

When running the program in the terminal, please add the correct path to the Caffe and deploy file.

The requirements are in the requirements.txt file. 

I hope you enjoy this script!
