# This is a CLI-based snake game made in cpp which makes it very fast.


## Important notes:
1. This game will *only* run in windows.
2. As I have used the `windows.h` and `conio.h` which through which I have used some functions which only work in windows. 
3. You can change the value of `sleep()` function A/c to your system specification for making the refresh rate of the CLI slow or fast.
4. To run this game on linux, You have to *change* the library and the system call function I have used here

## Getting started:
### Running the game:
1. Make sure you have a cpp compiler installed in your machine. like gcc/g++.
2. Open your terminal, navigate to the `Snake_Game_cpp` directory. using `cd Snake_Game_cpp`
3. Type `g++ Snake_game_using_cpp.cpp` in your shell.
4. Type `./a.exe` and enjoy the game.

### Playing the game:
1. Choose the type of game you want to play:
`Press 1 for Infinite game (you will never die)`
`Press 0 for The REAL snake-game (game-over if you touched the wall)`
